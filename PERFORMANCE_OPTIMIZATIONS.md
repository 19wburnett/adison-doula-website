# Performance Optimizations Applied

This document outlines all the performance optimizations that have been implemented in the Adison Doula website.

## 1. Image Optimizations

### Next.js Image Component
- All images use Next.js `Image` component with automatic optimization
- Configured image formats: AVIF and WebP for modern browsers
- Proper `sizes` attribute for responsive images
- Priority loading for above-the-fold images
- Lazy loading for below-the-fold images
- Quality settings: 85 for priority images, 80 for lazy-loaded images, 90 for lightbox

### Image Configuration (next.config.ts)
```typescript
images: {
  formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp'],
  deviceSizes: [640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200, 1920, 2048, 3840],
  imageSizes: [16, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 256, 384],
}
```

## 2. Animation Optimizations

### Reduced Motion Support
- Added CSS media query for `prefers-reduced-motion`
- All animations disabled for users who prefer reduced motion
- Custom hooks for reduced motion detection
- OptimizedMotion component wrapper

### RequestAnimationFrame
- Scroll listeners use `requestAnimationFrame` for better performance
- Passive event listeners where possible

## 3. Code Optimizations

### Next.js Configuration
- **SWC Minification**: Enabled for faster builds
- **Compression**: Gzip compression enabled
- **React Strict Mode**: Enabled for better development experience
- **Powered By Header**: Disabled for security

### Scroll Performance
- Navbar scroll listener optimized with RAF and ticking flag
- Passive scroll listeners to prevent blocking

## 4. Dark Mode

### Theme Management
- Using `next-themes` for proper theme management
- Prevents hydration mismatches
- System theme detection
- Persistent theme preference

## 5. Code Splitting

- Automatic code splitting via Next.js
- Dynamic imports for heavy components
- Route-based code splitting

## 6. Asset Optimization

### Video
- Background video with proper error handling
- Fallback to image if video fails to load
- `playsInline` for mobile compatibility
- Muted autoplay for better UX

## 7. Build Optimizations

### Production Build
- Minified JavaScript and CSS
- Tree shaking to remove unused code
- Optimized bundle size

## 8. Accessibility

- Proper semantic HTML
- ARIA labels where needed
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management

## 9. SEO

- Proper meta tags in layout
- OpenGraph tags for social sharing
- Structured data (implicit)
- Sitemap and robots.txt ready

## Performance Metrics to Monitor

1. **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Should be < 2.5s
2. **First Input Delay (FID)**: Should be < 100ms
3. **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Should be < 0.1
4. **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: Should be optimized
5. **Total Blocking Time (TBT)**: Should be minimized

## Future Optimizations to Consider

1. Implement service worker for offline functionality
2. Add image blur placeholders
3. Consider adding a CDN for static assets
4. Implement resource hints (preconnect, prefetch)
5. Add performance monitoring (e.g., Web Vitals)
6. Consider adding a loading skeleton for better perceived performance

## Testing Performance

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Test with Lighthouse
# Open Chrome DevTools > Lighthouse > Run analysis
```

## Recommended Tools

- **Lighthouse**: Built into Chrome DevTools
- **WebPageTest**: https://www.webpagetest.org/
- **GTmetrix**: https://gtmetrix.com/
- **Next.js Analytics**: Can be added via Vercel

## Bundle Analysis

To analyze the bundle size:

```bash
# Add to package.json
"analyze": "ANALYZE=true next build"

# Install analyzer
npm install @next/bundle-analyzer

# Run analysis
npm run analyze
```
